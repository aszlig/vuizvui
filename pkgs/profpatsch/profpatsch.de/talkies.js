Als Matsya riesig geworden war, warnte er Manu vor einer bestehenden Sintflut und riet ihm, ein Schiff zu bauen. W√§hrend der Flut ertranken alle Lebewesen, Matsya aber zog das Schiff mit Manu und den sieben Weisen zum Himalaya. Von dieser Flutsage gibt es unterschiedliche Versionen, eine davon findet sich im indischen Nationalepos Mahabharata.\nIn der rekonstruierten indoeurop√§ischen Mythologie ist *Monus der erste Mensch. Der im iranischen Avesta √ºberlieferte Mannesnamen Manus-ƒçiŒ∏ra weist darauf hin, dass dieser mythische Urmensch indoiranischen Ursprungs ist.[2] F√ºr die Germanen ist der Urmensch Mannus bezeugt. Nicht sicher ist, ob der phrygische Manes ebenfalls hierhergestellt werden darf.\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_(Hinduismus)" },
